      "title": "What is labor analogous to slavery?",
      "paragraph1": "According to Brazilian legislation, specifically article 149 of the Penal Code (amended by Law No. 10,803/2003), the crime of reduction to a condition analogous to that of a slave is defined as: \"Reducing someone to a condition analogous to that of a slave, either by subjecting them to forced labor or exhausting workdays, or by subjecting them to degrading working conditions, or by restricting, by any means, their movement due to debt contracted with the employer or agent.\"",
      "paragraph2": "The penalty is imprisonment from two to eight years, and a fine, in addition to the penalty corresponding to violence. The same article also establishes that anyone who restricts the use of any means of transportation by the worker, in order to retain them at the workplace; or maintains ostensive surveillance at the workplace or seizes documents or personal belongings of the worker, in order to retain them at the workplace, incurs the same penalties.",
      "paragraph3": "The law also provides for an increase in penalty when the crime is committed against a child or adolescent, or due to prejudice of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or origin. This legal definition is fundamental for combating this serious human rights violation in Brazil."

      "title": "The reality of slave labor in Brazil",
      "paragraph1": "According to official data from the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE), in 2024, 1,035 specific inspection actions were carried out to combat labor analogous to slavery, resulting in the rescue of 2,004 workers subjected to degrading working conditions. These operations ensured the payment of more than R$7 million in labor and severance pay to the victims.",
      "paragraph2": "Since 1995, when Brazil officially recognized the existence of contemporary forms of slavery, the Labor Inspection has rescued 65,598 workers in 8,483 inspection actions. Between 2003 and 2024, more than R$155 million in labor and severance pay were paid to victims.",
      "paragraph3": "The states with the highest number of rescued workers in 2024 were Minas Gerais (500), São Paulo (467), Bahia (198), Goiás (155), and Pernambuco (137). The economic areas with the highest incidence include building construction, coffee cultivation, onion cultivation, land preparation service, and horticulture.",
      "paragraph4": "An alarming fact is the significant growth in the number of workers rescued in urban areas, which represented 30% of the total workers in conditions analogous to slavery identified in 2024, demonstrating that the problem is not restricted only to rural areas.",
